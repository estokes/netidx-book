# Browser

The browser is a graphical tool that visualizes the contents of
netidx, it allows users to navigate to places of interest, view data
in tabular or vector form, and construct applications with custom
views and BScript.

Ignoring custom views, the browser attempts to infer from the
structure of the tree whether the path it's viewing should be
displayed as a vector, or a table. A vector looks like e.g.

![Vector mode](./browser-vector-mode.png)

Where as a table looks like, e.g.

![Table mode](./browser-table-mode.png)
