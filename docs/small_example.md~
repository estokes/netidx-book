# A Small Example

Suppose we have a small daemon that we run on many computers on our
network, and it knows many things about them, and does many things. I
won't specifiy exactly what it does or everything it knows because
that's irrelevant to the example. However suppose one of the things it
knows is the current CPU temperature of the machine it's running on,
and we would like to be able to access that for every machine on our
network. We heard about this new netidx thing, and we'd like to try it
out on this small and not very important case, what code do we need to
add to our daemon, and what options do we have for using the data?
